## License compliance

It is probably common wisdom in the open-source community that MIT License is one of the most permissive
and widely adopted licenses. However, the MIT License isn't the most lax license available; for example, there's
the [OSI-listed] No Attribution License, MIT-0.

*hh200* is explicitly licensed under the more popular MIT License, verbatim.

[OSI-listed]: https://opensource.org/license/mit-0
